 Version 1.8.0 (2014-07-30):
 ---------------------------

Emulation:
- ST video changes :
  - Handle 0 byte line by switching freq in STE mode
  - Use high res when ff8260 is set to 3
  - Randomly return 0 or 1 when reading unused bits 3,7 and 11 of
    color registers (except when running from ROM)
  - Better detection of bottom border removal on a 60 Hz screen
  - support for color change during only 4 cycles
  - better bitmap/color alignment for STE med res overscan at 60 Hz
  - Set default value of nSpec512Threshold to "1" instead of "16"
  - Update the position of the next VBL when 50Hz and 60Hz lines are mixed
  - When video address is set into IO region, keep the video pointer on 24 bits
- Videl changes :
  - correct masking of the true color palette registers
- CPU changes :
  - Fix a case when MFP's interrupt happens during the IACK sequence
    for HBL/VBL
  - Many prefetch changes required by some game's protection
- Sound changes :
  - Fix STE sound mixing using LMC when mixer=0 (DMA sound only)
  - Fix some crossbar's sound errors for Falcon
  - Fix Microwire's decoding of mask/data (based on official LMC1992's doc)
- FDC changes :
  - Add configurable RPM speed for each floppy drive, the possibility
    to turn each drive ON/OFF and the choice between single or double
    sided drive
  - Correct timings, behaviour and status register for all commands
    when a drive is OFF or empty.
  - Rewrite the index pulse part and all the delays expressed as disk's
    revolution
  - Add support for the "Force Int on Index Pulse" command
  - Rewrite the DMA functions for better accuracy
  - Add support for IPF/CTR files by using the capsimage library
  - Add open source support for Pasti STX files, including random/fuzzy bits
    and variable length bits. Also allow to save writes to a .stx file
    into an additional .wd1772 file (store 'write sector' and 'write track' data)
  - Don't force drives A and B at $4c2, keep the values detected by TOS
  - Many other timing / status register improvements
- GEMDOS HD emulation:
  - Fix: clip filenames given through GEMDOS calls to 8+3 length
    using first '.'
  - Fix: autostarting programs with GEMDOS-illegal host characters
    in their names
- ACSI hard disk changes:
  - Fixed/improved READ CAPACITY and INQUIRY commands
  - Unsupported commands are now handled correctly
  - Now using fseeko() instead of fseek() for supporting large images
- Other changes:
  - Don't enable MegaST's real time clock by default, it can cause some
    crashes in STF/STE mode
  - Improve ACIA's wait state with E clock
  - Add support for IKBD commands 0x11 and 0x13 (resume/pause output)
    and 0x17 (joystick monitoring)

Emulator:
- SDL GUI:
  - Update clock speed in the status bar when changing bus speed
    in Falcon mode
  - In the floppy dialog, use a checkbox to enable/disable drives A and B
    and another checkbox to choose single/double sided drive
  - In the screen dialog, add checkbox for --desktop-st option
  - Add a 2nd line in the status bar, with infos on FDC, joysticks, monitor
  - Fix OSX performance issue caused by statusbar and overlay LED
    doing their own SDL_UpdateRects() calls
- New command line options:
  - Options --drive-a and --drive-b to enable/disable drives A and B
  - Options --drive-a-heads and --drive-b-heads to select single or
    double sided drives A and B
  - --slowdown option to increase (multiply) VBL wait times
- New Native Features commands:
  - NF_EXIT exits emulator with given exit code
  - NF_DEBUGGER invokes Hatari debugger from native program
  - NF_FASTFORWARD sets fast forward on/off
- Tracing improvements:
  - Add option for tracing NatFeats calls
  - Fix: Xbios(255) modified the given argument string
  - Allow BIOS, XBIOS, GEMDOS, VDI and AES tracing to be enabled without
    enabling also X/BIOS interception, GEMDOS HD emulation or extended
    VDI mode
  - Show PC value for traced Bios/XBios/GemDOS calls
- Debugger:
  - Fix: release mouse in all cases where debugger can be invoked
  - Fix: DSP disassembler didn't in all cases show illegal opcodes correctly
  - Fix: "symbols" command crash when it was used during TOS bootup
  - Fix: TOS and cartridge addresses weren't (with all TOS versions)
    in address order which asserted in profile data post-processor
  - Fix: "next" command didn't work correctly in "hex" number base
  - Fix: depending on compiler/linker/assembler, DATA/BSS debug symbol
    offsets can in programs be either relative to their own, or to TEXT
    section start.  If former fails, try latter when loading symbols.
  - New "ym" info subcommand to show YM register values
  - "quit" command by-passes exit confirmation dialog and takes
    an optional Hatari exit code value
  - removed limits on breakpoints and their conditions
  - when entering debugger, current program's DRI/GST format debug
    symbols are automatically read from it, if such are available
  - new --debug-except option to specify which exceptions invoke
    the debugger, and WinUAE CPU core support for -D toggle option
  - "next"/"dspnext" commands work like in other debuggers, they
    skip subroutine/exception calls, for all other instructions
    they works like "step" command (earlier they always moved to
    next instruction in memory)
  - "next" and "dspnext" commands support optional "instruction type"
    argument, which can be used (for example) to continue emulation
    until subroutine returns
  - "history" command takes optional parameter specifying how many
    instructions of history will be tracked
  - CPU & DSP profile commands have now subcommand for profiling loops
  - "CpuInstr" and "DspInstr" variables for count of instructions
    executed since emulation was last continued from debugger
  - In addition to "!" condition, also "<" and ">" conditions can store
    the checked value (when both sides of conditions are identical).
    With above change, this can be e.g. used to detect and profile
    what are worst frames in games and why
  - New "rename" command to rename files.  Useful for scripted
    worst frame and spinloop profiling
  - Address space in 'dm' command can be given like in DSP disassembly,
    "dm x:$100", in addition to earlier "dm x $100" syntax
  - Fix out of bounds memory access that could result in bad disassembly
    output when using the external disassembler (only "dc.w" were printed)

Tools:
- Increased max partition size in atari-hd-image script to 512MB.
- New hatari_spinloop.py script for post-processing loop profile data.
  It can tell how many times loops were executed, how many times they
  spinned at minimum and maximum, at which VBL those happened, and what
  was the standard deviation of that.
- gst2ascii supports now both section relative and TEXT section relative
  DATA/BSS symbol offsets
- hconsole.Main() takes now Hatari command line options as argument
- AHCC/GCC/VBCC examples on using (all) Native Features APIs
- Improved mingw cross-compilation support

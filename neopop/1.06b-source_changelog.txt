        Win32 v1.06
        -----------

          subtle stretching artefacts.
        - Mostly translated the link-up dialog.
        - "Misc. Options" dialog. for various options.
        - Windowed/Full-screen mode is restored from registry on startup.

        - Put frameskipping back in.
        - Compressed with the latest version of UPX.
        - Improved sound consistancy, especially the noise channel - tones and
          noises are now maintained during mute, etc. And will be restored
          correctly from a saved state. This was a long-time problem.
        - Added full screen width stretching.

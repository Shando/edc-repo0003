What's New?
-----------
V1.21
+ Switched to Richard Mitton's excellent RAZE Z80 emulator, which fixes
  the out of time music on some games.
  Most of you described the problem as 'the music isn't in
  sync with the game'. Anyway, this is now fixed.

+ Sonic1/2/3, Aladdin are all fine now. I imagine there will be others.
  Eternal Champions's music is okay and you can play the game with Musashi.

+ DAC sound plays at the right pitch now (e.g. 'Sega' chord, 'Eswat' speech)

- No shadows yet (e.g. Sonic2 bonus game)

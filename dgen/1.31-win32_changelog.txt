v1.31 <- v1.30
 * Joystick axes can now be configured for controllers with more than two.
   They can also be reversed.
 * Implemented command "calibrate_js" to configure joystick buttons
   interactively.
 * Fixed a bug in the debugger prompt handler.
 * Implemented FM2612 debugging support.
 * Refactored SDL keyboard handling.
 * Removed Linux-specific joystick code which no one uses (not even in
   Linux, where the SDL version has always been preferred).
 * Implemented the ability to bind arbitrary commands to joystick buttons.
   This makes DGen fully controllable from a joystick/joypad.
 * Implemented proper sprite masking. This fixes annoying priority glitches in
   a number of games.
 * Fixed half-submitted commands support in the VDP. This finally fixes the
   mangled EA logo.
 * Some code refactoring and documentation.
 * Improved region settings. The single "region" variable can be used to
   switch interactively from one region settings to another (identifier,
   resolution, PAL/NTSC mode and frame rate).
 * Improved region auto detection with the ability to specify a preference
   order ("str_region_order" variable).
 * Fixed other miscellaneous bugs (NASM on non-x86 targets, uninitialized
   variables, other warnings and errors).

uBee512 v5.6.0

This is mainly an interim single bug fix release. The next major release
will have many new features and more bug fixes.

New for this release:
* Added Raspberry Pi 'deb', 'rpm' and 'tgz' binary distribution builds.

Changes:
* Compiled up against the LibDsk-1.3.5 library which now provides write
  support for CopyQM disk images along with many other changes since 1.2.1
  released in 2008-01-23. See the LibDsk ChangeLog.

Fixed:
* Fixed a problem when writing to CRTC 6545 display start high and low
  registers 12 and 13 was not refreshing the display.  This had been a long
  standing issue with some programs that changed these registers such as the
  Net ROM under the IC model where rubbish characters remained on the top
  line.

13 February 2017 - uBee
-----------------------
uBee512 v6.0.0

New for this release:
* In full screen or a maximised window using OpenGL mode, preserve the
  MicroBee display's 4:3 aspect ratio (especially on wide-screen 16:9
  monitors)

Changes:
* Revise video output to only redraw those parts of the screen that have
  changed, improving emulator performance.
* Changes made to 'keystd.c' to lower 'stopshift' and 'makeshift' values to
  work in Early Word (earlier version).
* Windows binary packages now ships with SDL-1.2.15 (final) DLL which
  replaces the older SDL-1.2.14 version.  The SDL (Windows) changelog is
  here: https://www.libsdl.org/release/changes-1.2.html

Fixed:
* LibDsk build for Linux was using wrong build prefix so was being built
  against an older LibDsk build.  Should now be LibDsk-1.4.2
* In memmap.c comment out the printf("file=...") line in sram_load().
* Fixed sram_save() in memmap.c to ignore an open new file error, now it
  only warns if using verbose mode.
